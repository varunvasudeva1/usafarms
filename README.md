# usafarms

Interactive heatmap visualization of the number of farms in the US, plotted by county. The plot is generated using the geom_polygon() function in R and
made interactive using the R Plotly library. Running the script generates a choropleth map with a varying color distribution to visually determine the
density of farms within the county. Counties are named with the accompanying state they are in.
